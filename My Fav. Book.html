    <p>Hello to all the viewers of this page hope you all are doing good.</p>
    <p>In this Html Website I am going to tell you all about my favourate
       book, My Favourate book is Journey through The Time by Geronimo Stilton.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>I just love the way Geronimo writes his story...<p>

    <p>The editor of The Rodent’s Gazette, Mouse Island’s largest newspaper. <b><big>Geronimo Stilton,</big></b> a mouse who always seems to land in trouble when he can’t stand up for himself yet somehow come out on top in the end, is accompanied by his sister Thea, cousin Trapp, and nephew Benjamin, as he is in most of the Geronimo Stilton novels.</p>

<p>In this installment, <b>Professor von Volt</b> invites <b><i>Geronimo</i></b> to his secret lab to show him the <i><b>Mouse Mover 3000,</b></i> his latest invention. Although initially reluctant to accept Professor von Volt’s offer to test out the time machine, Geronimo realizes his family would love to test it out and agrees to go with him.</p>

<p>As Geronimo travels through time from the age of the dinosaurs to the time of knights to the <b><big>pyramids of Giza</big></b>, he “enjoys” adventure in each stop. It’s almost like multiple books within one, which makes it somewhat easier to break down into smaller chunks for the reluctant reader.</p>

<p>The book remains as silly and nonsensical as ever, with Trapp thinking he’s funny and making things worse for Geronimo while Thea bosses him around like the stereotypical older sister. Benjamin has hero worship of Geronimo and believes he can do anything, which is part of why Geronimo is even willing to attempt some of his braver moments.</p>

<p>In addition to the story itself, I love how there are call outs throughout the book that present interesting facts and information that kids can learn from while enjoying the story, the perfect way to instill a curiosity and love of learning that is critical to success. I love the experiment of creating a Mobius Strip that the wee ones enjoyed learning about and figuring out. The same goes for information about knights and their code of chivalry, amongst other fun tidbits.</p>
